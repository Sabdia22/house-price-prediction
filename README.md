##  Project Stages

 **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Loaded and cleaned the housing dataset from Kaggle.
 **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Summary statistics, histograms, boxplots, and correlation matrix to understand data patterns and outliers.
 **Feature Engineering** – Encoded categorical variables and selected key predictors.
 **Modeling** – Trained and evaluated multiple models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
 **Model Evaluation** – Compared model performance using R², MAE, and RMSE. Performed 5-fold cross-validation for robustness.
